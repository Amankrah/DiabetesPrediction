5. [Build the Predictive System](#build-the-predictive-system)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib (for data visualization)

### Usage

1. **Import Data**: The notebook starts by importing the PIMA Diabetes dataset. This dataset is commonly used for machine learning tasks related to healthcare.
  
2. **Split Data for Training**: The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

3. **Train the Model**: The notebook covers how to train a machine learning model using the training data. It may explore different algorithms and techniques to fit the model.

4. **Model Evaluation**: After training, the notebook evaluates the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. This step helps in understanding how well the model will perform on unseen data.

5. **Build the Predictive System**: Finally, the notebook shows how to use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `diabetesprediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the notebook cells in sequence to go through the machine learning pipeline.
